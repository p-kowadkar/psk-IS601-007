The Milosians are an oppressed group that seek to reclaim their holy land from Creta: a militaristic country that forcefully annexed their nation. In the eye of the political storm is a girl named Julia Crichton, who emphatically wishes for the Milos to regain their strength and return to being a nation of peace.\n\nBefriending the girl, Edward and Alphonse find themselves in the midst of a rising resistance that involves the use of the very object they have been seeking all along—the Philosopher's Stone. However, their past experiences with the stone cause them reservation, and the brothers are unwilling to help.\n\nBut as they discover the secrets behind Creta's intentions and questionable history, the brothers are drawn into the battle between the rebellious Milos, who desire their liberty, and the Cretan military, who seek absolute power.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", 'thumb': 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/2/29550.webp?s=97851a04f3c1fa19e94e5818e25ee293', 'type': 'Movie'}, {'_id': '5114', 'title': 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood', 'alternativeTitles': ['Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Fullmetal Alchemist', 'Fullmetal Alchemist (2009)', 'FMA', 'FMAB', '鋼の錬金術師 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST', 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood', 'Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood'], 'ranking': 2, 'genres': ['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy'], 'episodes': 64, 'hasEpisode': True, 'hasRanking': True, 'image': 'https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1208/94745.webp', 'link': 'https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood', 'status': 'Finished Airing', 'synopsis': 'After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household, brothers Edward and Alphonse are left in a catastrophic new reality.

The fabled mythical object is rumored to be capable of amplifying an alchemist's abilities by leaps and bounds, thus allowing them to override the fundamental law of alchemy: to gain something, an alchemist must sacrifice something of equal value. Edward hopes to draw into the military's resources to find the fabled stone and restore his and Alphonse's bodies to normal.
